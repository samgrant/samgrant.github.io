    <section id="what-i-do">
      <h2 class="section-label">what i do</h2>
      <p>I define product vision and strategy, and build the conditions for teams to deliver it. That means getting clear on outcomes, making trade-offs explicit, and creating enough structure that people can move fast without constantly second-guessing the direction. I'm particularly good in environments where technical constraints, regulatory requirements or legacy complexity shape what's possible — because I understand those pressures well enough not to pretend they don't exist, and commercially astute enough not to hide behind them.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="why-i-do-it">
      <h2 class="section-label">why i do it</h2>
      <p>I want to work on products that earn their place — that genuinely improve people's relationship with something difficult, whether that's money, health, insurance or something else they've been underserved by. I do my best work in organisations that take that seriously — that are curious, direct, and willing to challenge how things have always been done.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="what-ive-done">
      <h2 class="section-label">what i've done</h2>
      <p>Product leader with 15+ years making complex, regulated products work for real people. I've spent most of my career in environments where the product decisions aren't just commercially important — they actually matter. Insurance people couldn't access. Pensions people didn't understand. Financial products that excluded the people who needed them most. That's the problem space I keep coming back to, and where I do my best work.</p>
