what-i-do:
    title: what i do
    summary: >
      I define product vision and strategy, and build the conditions for teams to deliver it.
      That means getting clear on outcomes, making trade-offs explicit, and creating enough
      structure that people can move fast without constantly second-guessing the direction.
      I'm particularly good in environments where technical constraints, regulatory requirements
      or legacy complexity shape what's possible -- because I understand those pressures well
      enough not to pretend they don't exist, and commercially astute enough not to hide behind them.

why-i-do-it:
    title: why i do it
    summary: >
      I want to work on products that earn their place -- that genuinely improve people's
      relationship with something difficult, whether that's money, health, insurance or something
      else they've been underserved by. I do my best work in organisations that take that
      seriously -- that are curious, direct, and willing to challenge how things have always been done.

what-ive-done:
    title: what I've done
    summary: >
      Product leader with 15+ years making complex, regulated products work for real people.
      I've spent most of my career in environments where the product decisions aren't just
      commercially important -- they actually matter. Insurance people couldn't access. Pensions
      people didn't understand. Financial products that excluded the people who needed them most.
      That's the problem space I keep coming back to, and where I do my best work.
