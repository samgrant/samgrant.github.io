    title: what I've done
    summary: |
      Over the course of my career, I have honed a diverse skill set that has equipped me to engage with stakeholders at all levels of an organisation to identify opportunities for growth and efficiency. Working closely alongside both engineering and executive teams, I have successfully developed and delivered a range of new products and initiatives, including those that simplify complex and heavily regulated products into intuitive, user-friendly services for customers to easily access.
      
      In addition to my core product and project management expertise, I have also facilitated workshops, team building events, strategy sessions, and have led Labs teams in utilising a lean, build-measure-learn approach to test and validate unproven solutions, driving innovation across multiple product areas.
