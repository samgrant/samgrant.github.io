what-i-do:
    title: what i do
    summary: I define product vision and strategy, and build the conditions for teams to deliver it. That means getting clear on outcomes, making trade-offs explicit, and creating enough structure that people can move fast without constantly second-guessing the direction. I'm particularly good in environments where technical constraints, regulatory requirements or legacy complexity shape what's possible — because I understand those pressures well enough not to pretend they don't exist, and commercially astute enough not to hide behind them.

why-i-do-it:
    title: why i do it
    summary: I want to work on products that earn their place — that genuinely improve people's relationship with something difficult, whether that's money, health, insurance or something else they've been underserved by. I do my best work in organisations that take that seriously — that are curious, direct, and willing to challenge how things have always been done.

what-ive-done:
    title: what I've done
    summary: |
      Product leader with 15+ years making complex, regulated products work for real people. I've spent most of my career in environments where the product decisions aren't just commercially important — they actually matter. Insurance people couldn't access. Pensions people didn't understand. Financial products that excluded the people who needed them most. That's the problem space I keep coming back to, and where I do my best work.

what-ive-done:
    title: what I've done
    summary: |
      Over the course of my career, I have honed a diverse skill set that has equipped me to engage with stakeholders at all levels of an organisation to identify opportunities for growth and efficiency. Working closely alongside both engineering and executive teams, I have successfully developed and delivered a range of new products and initiatives, including those that simplify complex and heavily regulated products into intuitive, user-friendly services for customers to easily access.
      
      In addition to my core product and project management expertise, I have also facilitated workshops, team building events, strategy sessions, and have led Labs teams in utilising a lean, build-measure-learn approach to test and validate unproven solutions, driving innovation across multiple product areas.
